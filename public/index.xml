I remember playing outside with my friends for hours without feeling too hot. But now, it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to be outside without feeling like we&amp;rsquo;re melting! Even at night, I have to use the air conditioning to sleep comfortably.&#xA;Over the years, temperature changes have been pretty noticeable, especially now with global warming and all.</description>

      <description>Global Perspectives THE BED CRISIS And possible solutions.

      <description>This is for an English assignment, and is extremely incomplete It was Tuesday and I had a long sports class at school. I was very tired. On the bus ride home, I was excited to see my dog Chewie. He always greeted me at the door with excitement, showing me his toys and asking for treats. Usually, we played for about ten minutes. But when I got home and opened the door, Chewie wasn&amp;rsquo;t there.</description>

      <description>Children all across the world yearn to bring their phones to school, for educational reasons, and to play music on the bus. Should children be allowed to bring phones to school?&#xA;The downsides Phones would give leeway to a lot of academic dishonor, from cheating on exams to using a calculator in maths class. Having a phone in class would make cheating a lot easier.&#xA;It would also lead to a lot of liability for the school, as storing a complex electronic device could lead to possible damage to the device, as well as to technological vulnerabilities in the school&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem, making it easier to &amp;ldquo;hack&amp;rdquo; into computers and potentially steal future exam papers/tests.</description>

      <description>Prologue Unless you&amp;rsquo;re living under a rock, you would know that Elon Musk bought Twitter. For all the people living in a cave Twitter is the world&amp;rsquo;s largest micro-blogging app, rivaled only by Koo, it also happens to be the worst place to share your opinion, Rivaled only by a school.&#xA;Originally, Twitter was meant to be a place where you could share anything you want - from your daily life to your opinion on the news - without having to worry about being suppressed.</description>

      <description>Image Im sure all of you can guess by the title, that there&amp;rsquo;s alot of potty humor in this. I mean, Loded Diper has been an iconic name for as long as I can remember Diper Överlode was an unexpected but welcome addition to the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, although not containing much, it was an enjoyable read for me and all my classmates.&#xA;Spoiler alert! (but you knew that) Educational Value B- Doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain much, but teaches readers the value of music, and how much artists strive for the spotlight, however small that spotlight is.</description>
