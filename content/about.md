My name is Pranav Thandassery and I’m an amateur designer, 3D artist, programmer, and writer. This blog is my space to show off what I’m working on and share my thoughts on whatever’s happening in the world.

I’m just a beginner in each of those areas, so I’m figuring things out as I go. For design, I’m always trying to come up with cool looking things and get better at my craft. In 3D art, I’m playing around with different techniques and trying to bring my ideas to life. With programming, I’m tackling new projects and learning new stuff bit by bit. But when it comes to writing, that's where this blog comes in. This is the place where I practice all my writing skills

So welcome to my blog, I'm Pranav Thandassery, and you're here for a reason, You have no choice but to go through every single project I've made.
