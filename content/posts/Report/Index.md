Global Perspectives
**THE BED CRISIS** 
<sup><sub>And possible solutions.</sub> </sup>

<hr>

# Introduction

Hospitals around the world were unable to handle the demand brought on by Covid-19 (also known as the Coronavirus), which resulted in what many refer to as the "Bed Crisis," when patients' need for beds skyrocketed.

## What happened to cause this?

During the first few years of the pandemic, little was known about Covid, leaving hospitals and clinics unable to prepare for the onslaught of patients catching Coronavirus.

This happened because of the virus’s ability to spread, hospitals were caught off guard by the sheer amount of people needing immediate care. Due to this, hospitals were not able to sufficiently provide enough beds to critical patients, leading to the unavailability of ICUs and essential equipment.

### The Impact

The sudden lack of space to house patients aggravated the severity of the virus and increased confirmed cases and deaths, significantly lengthening the pandemic.

In India, the surge of patients, continued to rise around the country to never-before-seen highs, resulting in many deaths that could have easily been avoided.

Whereas in Massachusetts, the percentage of covid victims that needed to be hospitalized was actually not that big, (about 5%), but due to the sheer volume of people infected by Covid, the hospital was still filled to its brim.

In fact,

The demand for emergency room beds was so high at UMass Memorial Medical Center, that some patients had to be cared for in hallways, with privacy barriers put up between beds.

"There is no capacity for patients right now in the UMass system," Hospital epidemiologist Dr. Richard Ellison said. "As soon as someone gets discharged, the bed is filled immediately."

Resulting in numerous and unnecessary complications to the patient's health, putting them at risk and, in some cases, resulting in death. 

## Proposed Solution

The solution to the hospital bed crisis is a multi-sided one, depending entirely on various factors such as the resources available, and the will.

Here are some possible solutions:

1.  Increase hospital bed capacity: This should be a no-brainer, possibly involving expanding hospitals or building new ones entirely
    
2.  Optimize the hospital discharge process: Many patients remain in hospitals far longer than necessary, and improving the hospital discharge process would greatly benefit the system.
    
3.  Prioritize resource allocation: During times of crisis, it is essential to prioritize resource allocation based on patients' needs, possibly meaning reallocating staff and resources from non-essential services
    

## What’s already in effect?

Depending on the region and the cause of the crisis, various measures have been implemented to address the hospital bed crisis. These measures include building new hospitals or expanding existing ones, temporarily suspending non-urgent procedures, and using alternative care settings such as hotels or community centres. 

Furthermore, telehealth services have been expanded to provide remote care to patients who do not require hospitalization, and staff from non-essential services have been redeployed to deal with increased demand. Finally, hospitals have prioritised critical care to ensure that patients needing immediate care receive it.
