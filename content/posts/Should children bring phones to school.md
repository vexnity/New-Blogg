Children all across the world yearn to bring their phones to school, for educational reasons, and to play music on the bus. Should children be allowed to bring phones to school?
# The downsides
Phones would give leeway to a lot of academic dishonor, from cheating on exams to using a calculator in maths class. Having a phone in class would make cheating a lot easier.

It would also lead to a lot of liability for the school, as storing a complex electronic device could lead to possible damage to the device, as well as to technological vulnerabilities in the school's ecosystem, making it easier to "hack" into computers and potentially steal future exam papers/tests.
# In conclusion
I don't think children should be allowed to bring phones to school, as it would put a lot of responsibility on the child, and liability on the school.
However, grades above 10th should be allowed to bring electronic devices as the class teacher sees fit.
